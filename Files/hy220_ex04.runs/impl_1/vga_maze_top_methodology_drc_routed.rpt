XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 10.000 -name clk [get_ports clk] (Source: /home/carv/Documents/Vivado_Projects/hy220_ex04_csd4334/hy220_ex04_csd4334.srcs/constrs_1/imports/lab3_code/lab3.xdc (Line: 13))

XDCC-7#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten on the same source  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint defined on the same source. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
